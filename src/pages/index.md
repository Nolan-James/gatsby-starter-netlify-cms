  title: Advanced level Energy Healer
  description: >
    I have been qualified as an Advanced level Energy Healer for well over a
    decade now working with the subtle energies of people, the planet and
    animals.  I have a keen interest in crystals, essential oils and herbalism
    especially plant based medicine and follow a vegan lifestyle.  I am from an
    ancestral line of natural healers and psychics working in and guided by the
    highest divine light.


    My dedicated healing room is a safe and welcoming space inspired by nature and infused with highest divine Angelic light.  Our intention is that you are embraced in these soft and beautiful higher vibrational energies during your session to wellness. Energy Healing works with the whole of you – physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.  Its effects can be quite life changing.  Your Aura also known as your energy field radiates out all around you and by cleansing, balancing and re-energising both your Aura and Chakra system we activate the body’s own natural ability to heal itself.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
